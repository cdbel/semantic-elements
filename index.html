    <h1>Howdy Partners!</h1>
    <p>Cats and Dogs are really <em>great!</em></p>
    <p>Both of these animals are also <strong>mammals!</strong></p>
    <p>And, not only are they mammals, but they are also pets. Here are a few common cat breeds:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Main Coon</li>
      <li>Ragdoll</li>
      <li>American Shorthair</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here are
      <mark>some</mark> of the most common breeds of dogs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Labrador Retriever</li>
      <li>German Shepherd</li>
      <li>Beagle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>House cats are generaly the same size, but dogs range in size from very large to tiny. Here are a few example:
      <h1>Kurdish Mastif</h1>
      <h2>Northern Inuit Dog</h2>
      <h3>West Siberian Laika</h3>
      <h4>Welsh Terrier</h4>
      <h5>Lancashire Heeler</h5>
      <h6>Yorkshire Terrier</h6>

    <p>I really like dogs and cats in different, but equal ways. Dogs are great for playing outside, and cats are nice to chill out with.</p>
